# Project 3

This project consists of the implementation of two procedures to deal with floating point numbers in MIPS _without_ using the floating point coprocessor. The main program must consist of a procedure to read two floating point numbers and the desired operation from standard input, then write the result on screen. Test procedures must be included so I can guarantee the program is ok. The delivery must include a report containing the algorithm for summing and multiplying floats, the test procedures' descriptions, and the assembler code.
